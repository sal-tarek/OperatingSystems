=== OS Simulation Console ===
Available commands:
  start fcfs    - Start simulation with First-Come First-Served scheduler
  start rr <q>  - Start with Round Robin (quantum q)
  start mlfq    - Start with Multi-Level Feedback Queue
  stop          - Stop the current simulation
  memory        - Print memory contents
  exit          - Exit the program
Press Enter to start with default scheduler (FCFS)
